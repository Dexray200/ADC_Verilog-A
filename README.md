# ADC_Verilog-A
Independent study/Thesis verilog-A test code and MATLAB ADC scripts

This is a section to store the scripts being created for my thesis work involving testing and creating a highspeed 14bit Successive Approximation Analog to Digital Converter

The ENOB folder holds the data and calculations used to measure the effective number of bits of the converter.
Currently testing a standard cell 10 bit SAR ADC using testbenches in Cadence Virtuoso and MATLAB/OCTAVE for the data processing.
